# EE-RAWSim-O-1
We extend it based on RAWSim-O and develop a new optimizer to make online decision for joint optimization of OA, PS, and TA. This new optimizer includes three options: M-I-G, M-II-G, and HADGS. The trigger of the new solver is cw ≥δ, ∃w ∈W. RAWSim-O is an open-source, agent-based and discrete-event-driven simulation framework developed by Merschformann et al. (2018). The source code is available at www.rawsim-o.de. Merschformann, M., Xie, L., & Li, H. (2018). Rawsim-o: A simulation framework for robotic mobile fulfillment systems. Logistics Research, 11, 8.
